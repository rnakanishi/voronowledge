A new data structure for storing and processing fluids simulations on sparse populated high-resolution uniform grids is presented: *SPGrid* (Sparse Paged Grid).
This structure ia able to construct an adaptive discretization for the simulation based on a tree-based representation has been placed (See figure on the right).

## Adaptive discretization

Adaptive structures are good for simulations because you don't want to have a fine resolution over all your domain. Instead, you usually want to refine in some regions where more detail is required. However, applying stencils is not an easy thing: accessing neighbors require go through different levels and different nodes of your tree structure.

**Figure 2:** Accessing neighbors in a quadtree structure requires to go through different levels of the tree. The targeted cell in blue has to travel through all levels to find its neighbors in red.

The idea behind SPGrid is to substitute the tree-based structure with a pyramid of sparsely populated uniform grids, as shown in the *Figure 2*.

### Pyramid of sparsely populated uniform grids
The equation to be solved here is the incompressible inviscid Navier-Stokes equations:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{u}_t + (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \frac{\nabla p}{\rho} &=& \mathbf{f} \\
    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} &=& 0

\end{eqnarray}
$$

with a splitting scheme. In the equation, $$\mathbf{u} = (u,v,w)$$ is vector velocity field; $$\mathbf{f}$$ is the external forces component; $$p$$ is the scalar pressure field; and $$\rho$$ is the fluid density.

**Figure 3:** Active cells and active faces in the pyramid structure. Adapted from the original paper.

To build the pyramid structure, it's necessary to identify cells and faces that can carry degrees of freedom. These cells are defined as *active cells* and *active faces*:

 - A cell is *active* if it is present in the geometry and is undivided in the octree;
 - A face is *active* if the face is present in the geometry and undivided in the octree;

Now that the pyramid structure for the simulations is well declared, it is necessary to perform discrete operations for the simulation: stencil operations within single levels; and operations through different levels of the pyramid.

### Discrete operators

**Figure 4:** Ghost cells are introduced per level of the pyramid structure. Adapted from the original paper.

Let's denote with $$l$$ the level of the pyramid. A cell that lives natively at level $$l$$  and has multidimensional index $$I$$ is denoted as $$C_I^l$$.
Also let's introduce a *ghost cell*. $$C_I^l$$ is a ghost if:

 1. $$C_I^l$$ is not active at level $$l$$;
 2. $$C_I^l$$ is neighbor of an active cell at level $$l_{lower} \leq l$$,
 3. There exists a less refined parent of $$C_I^l$$ at higher level $$l_{higher}> l$$ that is active.

Since the ghost cells live in different levels, it is necessary to define operations over those cells:

 - *Ghost value propagate*: upsampling routine. Each data of level $$l$$ is copied to a fine ghost children at level $$l-1$$.
 - *Ghost value accumulate*: downsampling routine. Each data of level $$l$$ accumulates contributions from any ghost children at level $$l-1$$.

**Discrete gradient** The pressure gradient values are defined in every face that borders an active cell as $$g = \frac{p_i-p_k}{\Delta}$$, for $$i\neq k$$ and $$i,k$$ cells with a shared face. The case where gradient lives between two cells of the same size is straight forward: $$\Delta = h$$ is the distance between cells center. In the case where we have neighbors of different sizes, the *propagate* routine computed earlier guarantee that there will have a ghost point to compute the gradient. The issue here is which $$\Delta$$ to use: in this case, $$\Delta = (h+\frac{h}{2})2 = 3/4 h$$ for a single level transition. As a general rule, $$\Delta = 3h_{min}/2$$, where $$h_{min}$$ is the size of smallest cell.

{: .image.medium.caption}
**Figure 6:** Computation of the $$h$$ value is different for each case.

**Divergence**
The volume-weighted velocity divergence on cell centers is computed as follows:

$$
V_{cell}\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u} = \sum_{faces}(\mathbf{u}_{face}\cdot\mathbf{n})A_{face}
$$

where $$\mathbf{n}$$ is the outward normal vector and $$A_{face}$$ is the area of that face. Similarly to gradient, ghost cells are used to compute the contributions of all faces. After all levels divergence was computed, tthe *accumulate* routine is called.

**Laplacian**
Since propagate routine is performed at the beginning of the sequence, and the accumulate ate the end, the laplacian is computed combining, in the middle of sequence, the per-level gradient and divergence.

## Adaptive multigrid preconditioner

**Figure 7:** The pyramid used in the SPGrid is on the right. Yellow cells are introduced for the multigrid scheme. Source: original paper.

To preconditionate the laplacian matrix and avoid instabilities in the simulation, a multigrid-based preconditioner  for adaptive grids is used.
For each level of the hierarchy, all cells are guaranteed to exist at the immediately coarser level. Such cells are created by copying the values of their counterparts on the next level of the octree (coarser level).

At the bottom of the multigrid V-cycle, a non multigrid is used to solve the coarse level problem. The upstroke of the V-cycle is the adjoint of the downstroke: ghost values of $$\mathbf{u}$ are propagated such that finer cells receive information from coarse neighbors.

## Advection scheme
During the simulation, most of the time it is of interest to compute quantities at locations other than specific grid -aligned locations, while balancing convenience and accuracy. To do this, an unstructured interpolation is performed. Ideally, an interpolation scheme should:

- return the exact value if the target point coincides with a location where physical quantity is stored;
- keep any advected quantity asymptotically unchanged.

### Per-cell interpolation
Consider we want to intepolate a value at $$(\xi_1,\xi_2)$$. First, a bilinear interpolation is performed at the center of the cell, obtaining $$\phi_c^I$$ from nodal values $$\phi_{00},\cdots,\phi_{11}$$: \$$\phi_c^I = \frac{(\phi_{00} + \phi_{01} + \phi_{10} + \phi_{11})}{4}\$$

Next, a correction $$\delta\phi_c = \phi_c - \phi_c^I$$ is computed and then, the final result for the interpolation scheme is obtained:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\phi(\xi_1,\xi_2) &=& \phi_{00}(1-\xi_1)(1-\xi_2) + \phi_{10}\xi_1(1-\xi_2) \\
    &+& \phi_{01}(1-\xi_1)\xi_2 + \phi_{11}\xi_1\xi_2 \\
    &+& 2\delta\phi_c\cdot\min{(\xi_1,1-xi_1,\xi_2,1-\xi_2)}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

### Per-face interpolation
In a three dimensional example, it is desired to obtain a value at the point $$(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)$$. First, assume the value is in the normal to the $$x$$-axis. First, the interpolated values $$u_L$$ and $$u_R$$ at the faces are obtained using the previous scheme. And then, a bilinear interpolation is performed: $$u($$(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)$$) = u_L(1-\xi_1) + u_R\xi_1$$.
